### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am a QA engineer

### I like to be involved in creating quality products that improve the world around us. The testing process reminds me of what a coach does when training an athlete. The more attention you pay to this process, the better the end result will be.

### I am currently involved in several interesting projects, two of which I am a Team Lead of the QA team. I do everything for comfortable and productive work.

### Main responsibilities:
- Establishing communication in the QA team;
- Establishing communication with development, design, product managers, and customer teams;
- Analysis of technical specifications and requirements, communication on proposals;
- Development of test documentation (Test Plan, User Story, Checklist, Test Case, Bug report);
- Setting up the test environment;
- Testing of the application - smoke, functional, security, API, load, regression (logging of bug reports);
- Control of bug fixes;
- General reporting on the work;
- Continuous analysis and improvement of the QA team's work at each stage.

### I will be glad to cooperate in the field of QA.

***Thank you for your attention and I wish you success!***
