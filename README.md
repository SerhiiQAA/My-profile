### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I am Automation QA Engineer
- ðŸ”­ I have 4 completed volunteer projects;
- ðŸŒ± I develop knowledge in such tools as Cypress and Playwright;
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on automation testing projects;
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was at a depth of 1000 meters
___
I like to be involved in creating quality products that improve the world around us. The testing process reminds me of what a coach does when training an athlete. The more attention you pay to this process, the better the end result will be.

### At the moment, I am focused on additional plugins for the Cypress tool
