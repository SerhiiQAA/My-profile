-  I have more than 2 years of active development in the field of testing;
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on testing projects;

I like to be involved in creating quality products that improve the world around us. The testing process reminds me of what a coach does when training an athlete. The more attention you pay to this process, the better the end result will be.

### I will be glad to cooperate in the field of QA.
